    "#### Suppose a quantity grows at a steady proportional rate of 3% per year. How long will it take to double? Quadruple? Grow 1024-fold?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Suppose we have a quantity x(t) that varies over time following the equation: dx(t)/dt = -(0.06)x + 0.36.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without integrating the equation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Tell me what the long-run steady-state value of x--that is, the limit of x as t approaches in infinity--is going to be.\n",
    "2. Suppose that the value of x at time t=0, x(0), equals 12. Once again, without integrating the equation, tell me how long it will take x to close half the distance between its initial value of 12 and its steady-state value. \n",

    "Now you are allowed to integrate dx(t)/dt = -(0.06)x + 0.36.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write down and solve the indefinite integral.\n",
    "2. Write down and solve the definite integral for the initial condition x(0) = 12. \n",

    "Explain whether or not, why, and how the following items are included in the calculation of national product:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The sale for $25,000 of an automobile that cost $20,000 to manufacture that had been produced here at home last year and carried over in inventory.\n",

    "Suppose that the appliance store buys a refrigerator from the manufacturer on December 15, 2018 for $600, and that you then buy that refrigerator on January 15, 2019 for $1000:\n",

    "#### Estimating National Product\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bureau of Economic Analysis measures national product in two different ways: as total expenditure on the economy’s output of goods and services and as the total income of everyone in the economy. Since – as you learned in earlier courses – these two things are the same, the two approaches should give the same answer. But in practice they do not.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the period 2006:Q4–2012:Q4, get quarterly data on real GDP measured on the expenditure side (referred to in the National Income and Product Accounts as “Real Gross Domestic Product, chained dollars” – these are the headline GDP numbers you will see discussed in the news) and real GDP measured on the income side (referred to as “Real\n",
    "Gross Domestic Income, chained dollars”).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Describe where you found the data.\n",
    "2. Compute the growth rate at an annual rate of each of the two series by quarter for\n",
    "2007:Q1–2012:Q4.\n",
    "3. Describe any two things you see when you compare the two series that you find\n",
    "interesting, and explain why you find them interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculating Real Magnitudes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When you calculate real national product, do you do so by dividing nominal national product by the price level or by subtracting the price level from nominal national product? \n",
    "2. When you calculate the real interest rate, do you do so by dividing the nominal interest rate by the price level or by subtracting the inflation rate from the nominal interest rate? \n",
    "3. Are your answers to (a) and (b) the same? Why or why not?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What, roughly, was the highest level the U.S. unemployment rate reached in:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. the 20th century? \n",
    "2. the past fifty years? \n",
    "3. the twenty years before 2006?\n",
    "4. Given your answers to (1) through (3), Do you think there is a connection between your answer to the qeustion above and the fact that Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan received a five-minute standing ovation at the end of the first of many events marking his retirement in 2005?\n",
