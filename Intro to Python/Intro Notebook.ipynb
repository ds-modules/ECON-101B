    "### A. Expressions\n",
    "The departure point for all programming is the concept of the __expression__. An expression is a combination of variables, operators, and other Python elements that the language interprets and acts upon. Expressions act as a set of instructions to be fed through the interpreter, with the goal of generating specific outcomes. See below for some examples of basic expressions."

You can also write your own functions, though, and at this point you already have the skills to do so. <br>\n",
