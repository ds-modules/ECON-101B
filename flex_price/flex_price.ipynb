    "\n",
    "#### Sources of Price Stickiness\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about the four possible source of price stickiness: money illusion, \"fairness\" considerations, misperceptions of price changes, and menu costs. What have you read or seen in the past two months that strike you as examples of any of these four phenomena? Which of the four strikes you as most likely to be the most important? Be brief!â€”one paragraph only.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Institutional Sources of Price Stickiness \n",
    "\n",
    "What changes in the economy's institutions can you think of that would diminish price stickiness and increase price flexibility? What advantage in terms of the size of the business cycle would you expect to follow from such changes in institutions? What disadvantages do you think that such institutional changes might have? (One paragraph only!)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Jean Baptiste Say \n",
    "\n",
    "in 1803 claimed that because nobody makes anything without intending to use it or sell it, and nobody sells anything without intending to buy something else, that there could be no general shortage of demand in an economy-- that there could be a planned excess of supply of some commodities, but it would be balanced by a planned excess of demand of some other commodities. Was he wrong? Why was he wrong?\n",
