    "1. Researchers who are trying to estimate the effects of changes in government purchases on real GDP often focus on military purchases because: a. The types of government purchases that policymakers are likely to use to combat a recession are similar in important ways to military purchases. b. Wars are often accompanied by price controls, which makes them particularly good times for isolating the effects of changes in government purchases. c. Changes in military purchases are caused mainly by geopolitical developments outside the United Sates, not by other factors affecting U.S. GDP. d. It is hard to obtain data on non-military purchases.\n",
    "2. “asset price bubble” means: a. A large, rapid rise in asset prices. b. A rise in asset prices that is reversed.c. A rise in asset prices in response to reductions in interest rates. d. Asset prices being greater than their “fundamental” values.\n",
    "3. Suppose a variable, y, is determined by a factor we can measure, x, and by other factors that we cannot. That is, y = a + bx + e, where a and b are parameters and e is the unobserved other factors. Estimates of b from a regression of y on x (estimated by “ordinary least squares”) will tend to overestimate the impact of x on y if: a. x and e are negatively correlated (that is, e tends to be low when x is high, and high when x is low). b. x and e are uncorrelated (that is, x has no consistent relationship with e). c. x and e are positively correlated (that is, e tends to be high when x is high, and low when x is low). d. a and x are positively correlated.\n",
    "4. The fact that the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers nearly caused the failure of institutions that had made loans to Lehman Brothers is an example of: a. “Confidence” contagion. b. “Coordination” or “Fire sale” contagion. c. “Counterparty” contagion. d. None of the above.\n",
    "5. The “borrowing” interest rate, rb, is usually higher than the “saving” interest rate, rs, because: a. Financial intermediaries’ information production, liquidity transformation, and diversification provision are costly. b. Government regulations limit the interest rates that banks can pay. c. The interest rates that foreigners can get on their savings are generally lower than interest rates in the United States. d. The inflation rate faced by savers is usually lower than the inflation rate faced by borrowers."
