    "This problem asks you to perform an event study. In the extension of the IS-MP-IA model to include an interest rate differential, a financial crisis is assumed to raise the differential. This problem therefore asks you to investigate whether interest rate differentials (often referred to as interest rate spreads) rose at the time of some of the major events associated with the financial crisis in the fall of 2008.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, consider the difference between the interest rates on BAA corporate bonds and on 30-year Treasury bonds. And consider any 3 of the following 4 events, all of which occurred in September 2008: (1) The government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; (2) Lehman Brothers’ announcement that it would file for bankruptcy; (3) The government takeover of AIG; (4) The House of Representatives’ rejection of the initial TARP legislation. (Note: no extra credit for considering all 4 events.)\n",

As far as you can tell, did it occur when financial markets were open (which, loosely speaking, corresponds to normal working hours in New York) or when they were closed? Describe how you found this information and how confident you are about it.\n",
    "2. For each event, if it occurred when financial markets were open, find the change in the interest rate spread on the day of the event. If financial markets were closed, find the change in the spread on the next day of trading. Did these events lead to noticeable increases in the interest rate spread? Be sure to describe where you found your data.\n",

Suppose also that rb1 – rs = d1(Y) and rb2 – rs = d2(Y), again with both functions decreasing. To reflect the idea that Type 2 investment is riskier than Type 1 investment, assume that for a given Y, rb2 – rs is greater than rb1 – rs, and that when Y falls, rb2 – rs rises by more than rb1 – rs does.\n",

    "2. One message we have stressed is that a modeling assumption is not inherently “good” or “bad”; the value of an assumption depends on the question we are trying to answer. Thus, give one example of a question that moving from a model with just one interest rate differential (rb – rs) to one with two differentials (rb1 – rs and rb2 – rs) would be helpful in answering. Give one example of a question where moving from a model with one differential to a model with two would complicate the analysis without generating any significant additional insights."

    "1. Why did America have a housing boom in the mid-2000s?\n",
    "2. Why did the conditions that had been required for mortgage borrowers before 2000--20% down payment, evidence of a stable job, no more than a 33% ratio of housing expenses (including utilities and taxes) to income-- disappear in the 2000s?\n",
    "3. Why did the world economy fall into a very deep economic recession at the end of 2008?\n",
    "4. What are the five (four positive, one negative) major components of national product on the expenditure side?\n",
    "5. Jean Baptiste Say in 1803 claimed that, because nobody makes anything without intending to use it or sell it, and nobody sells anything without intending to buy something else, that there could be no general shortage of demand in an economy--that there could be a planned excess of supply of some commodities, but it would be balanced by a planned excess of demand of some other commodities. Was he wrong? Why was he wrong?"
